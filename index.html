      <h2>Katerina</h2>
      <p1>I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my personal website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences and I use it to post my projects. I learn how to code and I use P5.js to create most of my work, which is demonstrated below.  </p1>

        <h4>Assignment 01</h4>
        <p2>For the first assignment, I wrote code to design a three-dimensional staircase. However, the outcome is determined by the designer, who decides the number of the steps the staircase consists of.<p2/>

        <h4>Assignment 02</h4>
        <p2>For the second assignment, I wrote code to design the pictures below. In the last picture, I recreated one of Sol LeWitt's works named ''The Location of a Triangle'', defining some of its steps parametrically based on the position of the mouse on the screen.<p2/>
